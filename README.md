# PyCondrop 0.19.09

## Readme
PyCondrop is a set of computer vision utilities for photovoltaic (PV) glass soiling analysis,
for evaluation of anti-soiling and self-cleaning surface coatings.
The programs included in the software package allow the user to:

### PyDrop
Analyze dew formation on the PV glass in laboratory and field conditions
- Determine the dew drop size and location
- Help user to calculate dew drop slide off times
Automatically calculate and map the area and location of parts of glass cleaned by sliding dewdrops using OpenCV methods
- Smart detection of dew water drops on the surface of the PV glass
- Motion detaction and drop path calculation

### PySurfaceArea
Provide tools for quantification of dust deposition on the surface of PV glass
- Using light refleaction intensity methods


## Requirements

Python 3.6 is required to run the application.<br />
[Anaconda Python](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html?highlight=conda) environment is advised. <br />
